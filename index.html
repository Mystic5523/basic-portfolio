        <p>Nick is a security guard currently for Allied Universal, stationed at Waddell &amp; Reed where he spends his time maintaining a secure facility and manning the main switchboard. But after over a decade doing so, he is wanting to get into the tech feild. He has some experience, but it is outdated and needs to be updated to the current job market.This line was intentionally left blank. You are currently reading some filler text. Some websites use something called Lorem Ipsum to fill in paragraphs that do not have their content finalized.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Nick is currently learning how to make websites with HTML and CSS. There needs to be something here, even though it's not what you might expect on a finished website. Eventually, text related to your business, services or products will replace this content. This is placeholder text that our web designers put here to make sure words appear properly on your website.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Nick is an avid Science Fiction and Fantasy fan. We aren't quite sure what to put here yet. This text isnâ€™t going to remain here because it doesn't pertain to the website. What you are reading now is not what you will be reading in this space once this website goes live. There needs to be something here, even though it's not what you might expect on a finished website. </p>
